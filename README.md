Js Libp2p Chat Tutorial
=======================
> Getting hands dirty with libp2p!

##What is this?
This is an interactive self-placed workshop. The aim to the workshop is to help p2p enthuciast get started with libp2p. Through this workshop you will build a completely decentralised chat system using the open source framework [js-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/).  

The material will focus on making user understand the dictionary of libp2p, then find right documentation, and self apply it. 

##For Whom?
The tutorial assumes that user has basic programming and networking skills. You don't need to have knowledge of crytography, blockchain, or advance networking to use this.

#How to use this?
The material is broken into chapters, it is highly recommentded to start sequencially. Every chapter aims to explain a module of libp2p, and proceed with overall developement of the chat system. Every chapter provides with description, references, and some tasks that you need to do inorder to proceed. 

It is totally normal to get stuck from time to time or to not understand what the material is attempting to explain. In those situations it helps a lot to discuss the problem in the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/libp2p-enthusiasts/community) or [create issue in the github repo](https://github.com/shresthagrawal/jslibp2p-chat-tutorial/issues). This also helps other users and improvement of the material itself.
