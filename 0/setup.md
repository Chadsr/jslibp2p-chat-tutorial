## Getting your system ready

1. It is highly recommended to use a text editor, eg. Sublimtext, Visualstudio, Vim, etc.  
2. You must have access to terminal. For windows users node.js terminal would work. 
1. As the tutorial uses node.js implementation of libp2p, install node.js. 
    - If you are a `MacOS` user you can use 
```bash
brew install node
```
    - If you are a `Ubuntu` user  you can use
```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```
    - for other operating systems please check the [official download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) of [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
