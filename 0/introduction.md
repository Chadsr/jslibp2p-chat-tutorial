Some Tips before you start
==========================
The repository of libp2p is continously changing, which means there can arrise following type of discrepencies:  
* The updated version no more supports the api explained in the workshop, in which case you must create an issue [here](https://github.com/shresthagrawal/jslibp2p-chat-tutorial/issues).
* You are refering to a wrong version of the documentation. Please check the exact version of the documnetation that you are using. You can find the your version of library in your `package.json`
* You might be using the right version and the right documnetation but still things break. There is a high possibility that the documnetation from the official repo is not updated in that case you must create an issue in [js-libp2p issues](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p/)
* The master branch might contain changes in the documentation that is not yet released. It is recommended to check the latest documnetation at [npm documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/libp2p) of js-libp2p
