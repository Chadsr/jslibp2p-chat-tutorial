* What is bootstrap? why do we need it?
* What properties does a boot startap node has
* By default how libp2p already gives an ipfs address and how we can fix a address for the bootstrap for easier purpose
* Make sure you have only one bootstrap running, because you cant have 2 nodes listening to the same port and address

Try it yourself
* Create a copy of index.js ad bootstrap.js 
* Add a fixed address
* Change the ports from '0'(which sets to the best open port) to a specific port.

Run it Locally, what do you see?
* Do you see ports and address specified?
