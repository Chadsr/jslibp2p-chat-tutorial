# Contributing

Here you'll find some guidelines on the "best practices" for contributing to `jslibp2p-chat-tutorial`.

## Environment Set-up

This repository utilises Prettier/ESlint/Babel with pre-commit hooks (thanks to Husky/Lint-staged) to ensure formatting styles stay standardized when making a contribution.

Before you start on a pull-request, make sure you have `node` and `npm` (or equivalent) installed on your system and then execute the following in your cloned repository:

```
cd jslibp2p-chat-tutorial/
npm i
```

This will ensure your local repository has everything it needs to enforce the basic styling guidelines enforced in the repository!

### Editor Linting

If your chosen editor supports it, enable Prettier/ESlint plugins for smoother integration.
